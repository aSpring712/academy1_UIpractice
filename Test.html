South Korea plans to set up a management scheme for COVID-19 vaccines, ahead of the vaccination program, due to start in February. Vaccine Roll-out President Moon Jae-in underlined an unwavering commitment to his peace process on the Korean Peninsula by improving relations with North Korea, Monday, despite rising concerns over a possible continued deadlock in both inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea relations under the incoming Joe Biden administration.
Speaking on Wednesday, an official at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said there will be a separate system, as there are numerous vaccines, which are different from conventional vaccinations. Vaccine Roll-out In a 27-minute New Year speech, President Moon said he would sit down with the North "at anytime, anywhere" to discuss cooperation, even in a non-face-to-face manner.More than 80 percent of the population in each country and the world must be inoculated to have the effect of herd immunity, so I will not hesitate to get a shot when my turn comes.
"This year marks the 30th anniversary of the two Koreas' simultaneous membership of the United Nations. The South and North must join hands to prove that peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula is beneficial for the international community," Moon said during the nationally-televised address. "It is our duty to pass on a Korean Peninsula without war and nuclear weapons to the next generation. In line with the launch of the U.S. Biden administration, the government will strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance and make a last-ditch effort to achieve a major turnaround in stalled U.S.-North Korea and inter-Korea dialogue."By Do Je-haeThe agency also said that people will be able to get the shots at designated hospitals or separate vaccination centers equipped with cold storage units.
The number is more than expected, so even if social restrictions are eased more, we should not always miss the tension.
